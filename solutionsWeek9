Problem 1:
struct is a way to combine multiple fields to represent a composite data structure. For example, we can store details related to a student in a struct consisting of his age (int), first_name (string), last_name (string) and standard (int). You have to create a struct, named Student, representing the student's details, as mentioned above, and store the data of a student.
Input Format
Input will consist of four lines. The first line will contain an integer, representing age. The second line will contain a string, consisting of lower-case Latin characters ('a'-'z'), representing the first_name of a student. The third line will contain another string, consisting of lower-case Latin characters ('a'-'z'), representing the last_name of a student. The fourth line will contain an integer, representing the standard of student.
Constraints
The number of characters in first_name and last_name will not exceed 50.
Output Format
Output will be of a single line, consisting of age, first_name, last_name and standard, each separated by one white space.
Sample Input 0

Sample Output 0

#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct student{
        int age;
        char fname[51];
        char lname[51];
        int standard;        
};
int main(){
    struct student s1;
        scanf("%d",&s1.age);
        scanf("%s",s1.fname);
        scanf("%s",s1.lname);
        scanf("%d",&s1.standard);
        printf("%d %s %s %d",s1.age,s1.fname,s1.lname,s1.standard);
        return 0;
}

Problem 2:
A tournament was held in LPU. There were 11 players in team. Each team member has scored some runs. Create a structure that contains player id and runs scored by each player. You need to calculate the final score scored by cricket team.
Input Format
Input consist of player id and runs scored by each player.
Constraints
no. of players in cricket team are 11.
Output Format
Display the total score of a team.
Sample Input 0
11
1 10
2 10
3 10
4 10
5 5
6 5
7 5
8 5
9 5
10 5
11 5
Sample Output 0
75
